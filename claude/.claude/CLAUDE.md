## Git Commit Guidelines

When creating git commits:

- Only focus on **staged changes** when generating commit messages
- Ignore any unstaged modifications
- The user will stage the specific changes they want to commit
- Generate commit messages based solely on the staged content

Important Notes:

- Do not include unstaged changes in commit message descriptions
- Trust that the user has properly staged the intended changes
- Focus commit messages on what is actually being committed (staged files only)
